From 2018 to 2023, I worked at **Kherbouche Enterprise InterEntreprise**, where I started as a **Senior Odoo (OpenERP) Developer** and later became the **Project Manager** for their ERP systems.

The company‚Äôs system was built on **OpenERP 6**, an older but stable version of the Odoo framework. My role spanned across the entire lifecycle of the ERP system, including:

### üß© Responsibilities as a Developer (2018‚Äì2021)

- Maintaining and improving an existing **OpenERP 6-based ERP**
- Debugging Python modules and customizing Odoo's internal models
- Creating and updating business-specific modules for accounting, inventory, HR, and sales
- Writing reports and wizards to automate internal workflows
- Integrating external tools with Odoo (PDF, email, exports)

### üßë‚Äçüíº Transition to Project Manager (2021‚Äì2023)

As I gained more experience, I was promoted to **ERP Project Manager**, where I led the technical evolution of the system and coordinated between technical staff and end users.

Key responsibilities included:

- Planning and prioritizing feature development based on business needs
- Coordinating a small team of developers and analysts
- Handling direct communication with stakeholders and department heads
- Maintaining the production environment and ensuring system uptime
- Managing change requests and deployment cycles

### üñ•Ô∏è Infrastructure & Admin Skills

In addition to my Odoo work, I managed the **Linux Ubuntu** servers hosting the ERP system:

- Performing routine backups and upgrades
- Writing shell scripts for task automation
- Administering PostgreSQL databases used by OpenERP
- Ensuring system security and SSH-based access management

### üìú Certifications & Trainings

During my time at the company, I also had the opportunity to receive formal training in:

- **ITIL v4** ‚Äî Best practices for IT service management
- **ISO 9001** ‚Äî Qualified as an **Internal Auditor** for quality management systems

These certifications helped me apply structured approaches to IT processes and quality assurance across both technical and managerial tasks.

This experience gave me solid foundations in **ERP architecture**, **legacy system maintenance**, and **technical project leadership**, while sharpening my skills in **Odoo development**, **Linux system administration**, and **PostgreSQL database management**.

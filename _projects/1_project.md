The first project Iâ€™d like to share is my experience working on [**ERBuilder**](https://soft-builder.com/erbuilder-data-modeler/), a professional data modeling tool developed by _SoftBuilder_. ERBuilder enables users to visually design, generate, and reverse engineer databases across multiple relational database management systems.

I contributed to the development of this tool using **Pascal (Delphi)**, which was used for both the UI and the core logic of the application. This project gave me hands-on experience with reverse engineering logic and SQL generation, while working in a statically typed and component-oriented language.

In this project, I worked on:

- Extracting schemas from live and remote databases
- Generating platform-specific SQL scripts (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc.)
- Enhancing metadata parsing and model visualization
- Ensuring compatibility across various relational databases
- Improving UX features within the Delphi-based UI

This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge of database internals and develop robust software using Pascal/Delphi in a commercial-grade application.

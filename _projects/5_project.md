I am currently working as a **Research Engineer at Inria** within the **STACK team**, where I am developing an **extension for Ansible** that integrates the **coordination mechanisms of Concerto**, a high-level model for orchestrating distributed applications.

The objective of this project is to enhance Ansible with **declarative coordination logic**, enabling it to manage complex distributed deployment workflows with native synchronization, event-driven behavior, and inter-component orchestration.

This work is supervised by **HÃ©lÃ¨ne Coullon** and **Baptiste Jonglez**, and takes place within **IMT Atlantique** and **Inria Nantes**, in the context of research on automated infrastructure and edge/cloud software management.

### ðŸ§  Project Goal

- Combine Ansible's widespread usage and simplicity
- With **Concerto's formal coordination model**
- To produce a tool that supports **adaptive and reactive orchestration**

This would enable developers and DevOps engineers to write expressive, **dependency-aware**, and **resilient playbooks** that adapt to real-time system behavior.

---

### ðŸ›  Technologies Involved

- **Ansible** (automation tool)
- **Concerto DSL** (for coordination)
- **Python & YAML** (for implementation and integration)
- Concepts like **stateful orchestration**, **workflow graphs**, and **runtime control**

---

This project is currently under active development and is part of a broader vision within the **STACK team** to improve the automation and reliability of **distributed software deployment** from edge to cloud.

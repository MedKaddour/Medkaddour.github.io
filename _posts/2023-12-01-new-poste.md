On **December 1st, 2023**, I joined **[IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en)** as a **Research and Development Engineer** to work on **feedback mechanisms for Edge-to-Cloud video processing applications**.

The project focused on improving the **monitoring**, **analysis**, and **adaptation** of distributed applications across heterogeneous environments. I had the opportunity to design and implement a full feedback loop that connects metrics collection, performance monitoring, and automated reactions.

### üîç Project Objectives
- Improve **observability** of distributed video pipelines (motion detection, object recognition)
- Enable **dynamic feedback** to ensure performance and quality objectives are met
- Detect and respond to **SLO violations** through actionable insights

### ‚öôÔ∏è My Contributions
- Designed a **monitoring pipeline** using **Prometheus** and **OpenTelemetry**
- Implemented **metrics collection** on FPS, latency, processing time, and object recognition quality
- Developed a **Flask-based interface** for visualizing critical metrics and system health
- Created a **prototype** integrating:
  - A camera simulator
  - Motion detection at the edge
  - Cloud-based object recognition (YOLOv5)
- Traced processing flow end-to-end using **distributed tracing**

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- Python, Flask  
- Prometheus & OpenTelemetry  
- Docker, Docker Compose  
- GitLab CI/CD  
- YOLOv5, OpenCV  
- Grafana (for metric dashboards)

### üìò Outcomes
- Developed and documented an **open-source prototype**:  
  [GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.inria.fr/feedback-mechanisms-progress-monitoring/use-case-video-processing/)
- Explored potential extensions using **critical metric detection** and **SLI/SLO reasoning**
- Shared findings internally and supported future directions at IMT Atlantique and Inria

This experience helped shape my current work on **resilient, adaptive applications**, and provided a solid foundation for my ongoing research on intelligent configuration and monitoring systems.

I am a research and development engineer at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr), affiliated with the STACK team. I focus on **feedback mechanisms and performance monitoring for Edge-to-Cloud applications**, working on **distributed systems**, **urgent computing**, and **resource-aware service placement**.

Currently, I develop and integrate **CoAnsible**, an extension of Ansible that enhances automation across heterogeneous compute environments.

I work with technologies such as **Kubernetes**, **Prometheus**, **OpenTelemetry**, and **Ansible**, and often experiment on platforms like **Gridâ€™5000**.
